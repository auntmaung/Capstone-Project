## 📌 Contribution Guidelines

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/auntmaung/Capstone-Project.git
   cd Capstone-Project
   ```

2. **Create a New Branch**

   Always create a new branch based on `main`. Name it clearly according to the feature or bug fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make Your Changes**

   Add or update code as needed. Please follow these code quality practices:
   - Keep your code clean and readable
   - Follow naming and formatting conventions already used
   - Keep commits focused and meaningful
   - Add or update comments where helpful

4. **Commit and Push Your Changes**

   After verifying your changes locally, commit and push your branch to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: a brief but clear description of your change"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Open a Pull Request (PR) to `main`**

   Go to the GitHub repository and:
   - Click **"Compare & pull request"**
   - Ensure the base branch is `main`
   - Add a clear PR title and description of your changes
   - Submit the PR and wait for review

   > ❗ Note: Direct pushes to `main` are **not allowed**. The branch is protected. All changes must go through PRs and be reviewed before merging.
